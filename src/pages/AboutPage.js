                    This will one day be a turn based role-playing game using web technologies.
                    Using React, Node, Express and MongoDB. Of course HTML and CSS. Also
                    plans for creating a web based dungeon creation application.
                </p>
                <p className="about">
                    Inspired by my love of table top games and nethack. I like the turn based
                    system to give more ability explore and socialize rather then run through
                    an adventure as quickly as possible. Plus it should allow for the ability
                    to inject creativity and uniqueness into the adventure.
